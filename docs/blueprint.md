# **App Name**: GlobalMind Quiz

## Core Features:

- Quiz Question Display: Display multiple-choice and true/false questions related to global cultures, languages, and educational systems.
- Instant Feedback: Provide immediate feedback (correct/incorrect) after each answer, with a brief educational justification, curiosity, or additional context.
- Scoring System: Implement a point system based on correct answers and question difficulty, displaying the player's current score prominently.
- Score Ranking: Show the top 10 players with the highest scores in a persistent ranking.
- Progress Tracker: Visually track the quiz progress using an indicator that shows the number of answered questions and remaining questions.
- Adaptive Difficulty: Use a tool that employs generative AI to adapt quiz difficulty based on user performance. It will reason over whether to offer easier questions if a user struggles, or more challenging questions if the user excels.
- Multimedia Integration: Enhance engagement by integrating relevant images (flags, landmarks, festivals) and audio clips (greetings in different languages, traditional music excerpts).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) to reflect knowledge and exploration. This vibrant color is suitable for the fun yet serious tone of the educational game.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF) to provide a soft, non-distracting backdrop that complements the primary color.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), for highlights and interactive elements.  Its greater brightness and saturation will help attract attention.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and clear reading experience. It works well for both headers and body text.
- Use flat, vector-based icons to represent different categories and actions within the quiz.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure a consistent user experience.
- Implement smooth transitions between questions and subtle animations for correct/incorrect feedback to enhance user engagement.
